Hello, I am Ronast Subedi. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the [`Florida State University`](https://www.fsu.edu/). I work as a Graduate Research Assistant, advised by [`Prof. Dr. Shayok Chakraborty`](https://shayokch.com/). My reseacher focuses on active learning, domain adaptation, learning in presence of noisy labels. 


I am a passionate and results-driven engineer with a strong foundation in computer science. With over three years of research and development experience, I specialize in delivering advanced machine learning and software solutions. I am seeking opportunities to apply my extensive technical skills and innovative problem-solving abilities in challenging machine learning, data science, or software development roles. I thrive in dynamic environments and am committed to delivering projects on time and to specification. If there are opportunities that align with my background, I would appreciate the chance to [`connect`](/contact/). Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing potential collaborations.

<!-- My background includes diverse research and industry projects, where I’ve gained experience in applying various deep learning techniques to develop software solutions for practical problems. I have worked with active learning, self-supervised learning, federated learning, image segmentation, object detection, and generative models like GANs and VAEs. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering (IOE), Pulchowk Campus. -->
