Hello, I am Ronast Subedi. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at [`Florida State University`](https://www.fsu.edu/). I work as a Graduate Research Assistant, advised by [`Prof. Dr. Shayok Chakraborty`](https://shayokch.com/). My work focuses on weakly supervised machine learning and its application in Active Learning, Computer Vision, and medical domains. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering (IOE), Pulchowk Campus.

I am a passionate and results-driven engineer with a strong foundation in computer science. With over three years of involvement in research and development projects, I have experience in delivering machine learning and software solutions. I love to apply my technical skills and problem-solving abilities in machine learning, data science, and software development areas.

<!-- I thrive in dynamic environments and am committed to delivering projects on time and to specification.  -->

<!-- My background includes diverse research and industry projects, where Iâ€™ve gained experience in applying various deep learning techniques to develop software solutions for practical problems. I have worked with active learning, self-supervised learning, federated learning, image segmentation, object detection, and generative models like GANs and VAEs. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at  -->
